# GUI-dipole-array-modeling
The least square method is used to reconstruct the equivalent dipole array with simulated/measured near field components
The reconstruction for the case with non-ideal ground plane can be done with the fields above and below the ground plane (some metigation makes the reconstruction possible). More detail can be found in the paper of this repo.
